<br>

<h2><a name="aslang_t" href="#aslang_c">Assembly Language </a></h2>

<br>

> A lot of modern Assembly Language classes use AL as a sort of “introduction to computer architecture”, rather than treating it as a useful programming language. That’s one path, and certainly valuable, but you might be better off finding a book from the 70s or early 80s, when actually writing in AL was one of the few high-performance alternatives around.
>
> Modern architectures (ARM, MIPS, x86) make it really annoying to try to learn their assembly languages, since architectures are no longer “aimed” at assembly programmers. The instruction sets are easy for a compiler to deal with, but awkward and poorly documented for humans.

Must Read

- **Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach** (7th, 2016) by Kurose, Ross  
  Best for a beginner. You will fall in love with this book once you get hold of it :P. No prerequisites required. It is written marvelously for anyone to get interested in networking)
- Computer Networks (5th, 2010) by Andrew S. Tanenbaum and David J. Wetherall 
  Good but dry. Well formed contents, should have some basic understanding of data communications before reading this book.
